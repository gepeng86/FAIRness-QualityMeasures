Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

***1. What are the FAIR principles?***

The FAIR Principles are a set of high-level data management and stewardship guidelines for making digital resources Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. They aim to optimize data sharing and reuse for both humans and machines across disciplines and systems.

***2. Why is there a need to harmonize FAIRness assessment?***

Different domains and organizations interpret and apply the FAIR principles in various ways, leading to inconsistencies in how FAIRness is assessed. Harmonizing FAIRness assessments ensures that evaluations are consistent across different fields, allowing for better comparisons and improved data interoperability.

***3. What are the key components of the framework?***

There are three key components:
* **Consolidated FAIR Vocabulary**: A harmonized vocabulary that helps standardize FAIRness assessments.
* **Quality Measures**: Fundamental concepts such as identifiers, metadata, and vocabularies that are essential for FAIR compliance.
* **FAIR-QMM**: A maturity matrix to assess and report compliance in a systematic, tiered, and strauctured way.
