Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
=================================

## ***1. What are the FAIR principles?***<br/>
The FAIR Principles are a set of 15 high-level data management and stewardship guidelines for enabling digital resources Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. They aim to optimize data sharing and reuse for both humans and machines across disciplines and systems.<br/><br/>

## ***2. Why is there a need to harmonize FAIRness assessment?***<br/>
Different domains and organizations interpret and apply the FAIR principles in various ways, leading to inconsistencies in how FAIRness is assessed. Harmonizing FAIRness assessments ensures that evaluations are consistent across different fields, allowing for better comparisons and improved data interoperability.<br/><br/>

## ***3. What are the key components of the framework?***<br/>
There are three key components:
* **Consolidated FAIR Vocabulary**: A harmonized vocabulary that helps standardize FAIRness assessments.
* **Quality Measures**: unique core concepts such as identifiers, metadata, and vocabularies that are essential for FAIR compliance.
* **FAIR-QMM**: A maturity matrix to assess and report compliance in a systematic, tiered, and structured way.<br/><br/>

## ***4. What are FAIRness Quality Measures?***<br/>
FAIRness Quality Measures are twelve unique core concepts identified from the FAIR Principles: Identifier, Rich Metadata, Resource, Protocol, Procedure, Language, Vocabulary, Reference, Attribute, License, Provenance, and Standard. These measures act as common pillars for building holistic FAIRness assessment workflows.<br/><br/>

## ***5. What is the FAIRness Quality Maturity Matrix (FAIR-QMM)?***<br/>
The FAIR-QMM is a structured framework that provides a tiered and progressive approach for assessing and reporting FAIRness. It defines three levels of compliance maturity (Minimal, Intermediate, Optimal) and evaluates the extent to which data and metadata meet the FAIR principles.<br/><br/>

## ***6. What are some challenges the framework addresses?***<br/>
* Discrepancies in interpreting the FAIR principles across domains.
* Lack of consistency in comparing FAIRness results from different tools.
* Ensuring machine-actionability of data and FAIRness quality information for seamless integration and automated use across systems.<br/><br/>

## ***7. How does the framework benefit organizations?***<br/>
By utilizing the Quality Measures and FAIR-QMM, organizations can:
* Assess consistently and holistically the current FAIRness of their data holding;
* Identify areas for improvement;
* Create roadmaps for achieving higher compliance if needed;
* Ensure machine-actionability of both data and quality information, promoting data sharing and reuse across disciplines.<br/><br/>
