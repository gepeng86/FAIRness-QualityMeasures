**Category-Specific Requirements of the FAIR Principles**
---------------------------------------------------------

The category-specific requirements mapped from FAIR Principles are defined in Peng et al. (2024) and captured in the diagram below. The naming convention for requirement identifiers (REQ IDs) is: {FAIR ID}-REQ-{Category ID}, where, {FAIR ID}=[F1, F2, F3, F4; A1, A1.2, A1.2, A2; I1, I2, I3; R1, R1.1, R1.2, R1.3], denoting individual FAIR principles, respectively;  {Category ID]=[D; M; IS}, denoting the Data, Metadata, and Infrastructure category, respectively. 

Adapted from Bailo (2019) and Peng (2023; updated in 2024), this diagram depicts FAIR requirements specific to data, metadata, and infrastructure adhering to the definition of individual FAIR principles, and emphasizes the importance of enterprise capabilities in terms of processes, systems, standards, tools, and skills, in supporting FAIR data. All four components are essential in systematically improving the FAIRness of the overall scientific data collection of individual organizations.
