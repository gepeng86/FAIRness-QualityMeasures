**Category-Specific Requirements of the FAIR Principles**
---------------------------------------------------------

The category-specific requirements mapped from the FAIR Principles are defined in [Peng (2023)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7896947) and updated in Peng et al. (2024), which is also discussed the importance of establishing and imprvoing enterprise capabilities. They are consolidated in the diagram below [(Peng 2024)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11315841). 

The naming convention for requirement identifiers (REQ IDs) is: {FAIR ID}-REQ-{Category ID}, where, {FAIR ID}=[F1, F2, F3, F4; A1, A1.2, A1.2, A2; I1, I2, I3; R1, R1.1, R1.2, R1.3], denoting individual FAIR principles, respectively;  {Category ID]=[D; M; IS}, denoting the Data, Metadata, and Infrastructure category, respectively. 

Adapted from Bailo (2019) and Peng (2023; updated in 2024), this diagram (Peng 2024) depicts the FAIR requirements specific to data, metadata, and infrastructure adhering to the definition of individual FAIR principles, and emphasizes the importance of enterprise capabilities in terms of processes, systems, standards, tools, and skills, in supporting FAIR data. All four components are essential in systematically improving the FAIRness of the overall scientific data collection of individual organizations.
