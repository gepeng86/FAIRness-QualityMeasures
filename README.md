FAIR Quality Measures
=====================

This repository describes the FAIR quality measures from Peng et al. (2024). The FAIR quality measures are derived from the FAIR Principls (Wilkinson et al. 2016), utilizing a concept mapping approach.

The common set of FAIR vocabulary defined in Peng et al. (2024) is presented with definitions and ontology specification. The common FAIR vocabulary is beneficial for harmonizing FAIRness assessment and reporting towards machine-actionable quality information.
