FAIRness Quality Measures
=====================

**Introduction**
-----------------

This repository describes the coutcomes from [<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Peng et al. (2024)</span>](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10533920). 

The FAIRness quality measures are a set of unique core concepts contained in the definitions of the FAIR Principls ([<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Wilkinson et al. 2016)</span>](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18), that can be used to evaluate the level of FAIR-compliance, i.e., FAIRness. The core concepts are deduced by decomposing the definitions through a concept mapping approach described in [<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Peng (2023)</span>](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023EO230216).

The FAIRness quality measures can serve as common, fundamental pillars of holistic FAIRness assessment workflows. More information can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/gepeng86/FAIRness-QualityMeasures/tree/main/FAIR%20Quality%20Measures). 

A common FAIR vocabulary defined in Peng et al. (2024) is presented with definitions and ontology specifications (working in progress). The common FAIR vocabulary is beneficial for harmonizing FAIRness assessment and reporting towards machine-actionable FAIRness quality information. More information can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/gepeng86/FAIRness-QualityMeasures/tree/main/Common%20FAIR%20Vocabulary).

A FAIRness quality maturit matrix (FAIR-QMM) crafted by Peng et al. (2024) is also presented. The FAIR-QMM is a structured, tiered, and progressive approach for evaluating and reporting the degree of FAIR-compliance. It can be used as a FAIRness assessment tool independently and/or as a translator between other FAIRness assessment tools or models. More information can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/gepeng86/FAIRness-QualityMeasures/tree/main/FAIRness%20Quality%20Maturity%20Matrix).
