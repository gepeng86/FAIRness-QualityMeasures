Harmonizing Quality Measures of FAIRness Assessment Towards Machine-Actionable Quality Information
===================================================================================================

**Introduction**
-----------------

This repository highlights the outcomes from [<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Peng et al. (2024)</span>](https://doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2024.2390431), published by [<span class="underline" style="color:blue">the International Journal of Digital Earth</span>](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tjde20) 
 of Taylor & Francis for a special collection ([<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Advance in FAIR Geospatial Information Resources</span>](https://think.taylorandfrancis.com/article_collections/international-journal-of-digital-earth-advances-on-fair-geospatial-information-resources/)). 

The FAIRness quality measures established by Peng et al. (2024) are a set of unique core concepts contained in the definitions of the FAIR Principls ([<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Wilkinson et al. 2016)</span>](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18), that can be used to evaluate the level of FAIR-compliance, i.e., FAIRness. The core concepts are deduced by decomposing the definitions through a concept mapping approach described in [<span class="underline" style="color:blue">Peng (2023)</span>](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023EO230216). The FAIRness quality measures can serve as common, fundamental pillars of holistic FAIRness assessment workflows. More information can be found in [this folder](./FAIR%20Quality%20Measures). 

A common FAIR vocabulary defined in Peng et al. (2024) is presented with definitions and ontology specifications (working in progress). The common FAIR vocabulary is beneficial for harmonizing FAIRness assessment and reporting towards machine-actionable FAIRness quality information. More information can be found in [this folder](./Common%20FAIR%20Vocabulary).

The FAIRness quality maturit matrix (FAIR-QMM) crafted by Peng et al. (2024) is also presented. The FAIR-QMM is a structured, tiered, and progressive approach for evaluating and reporting the degree of FAIR-compliance. It can be used as a FAIRness assessment tool independently and/or as a translator between other FAIRness assessment tools or models. More information can be found in [this folder](./FAIRness%20Quality%20Maturity%20Matrix).

Data, Metadata, Infrastructure, and Enterprise Capability are considered as four essential components for FAIR data. The requirements derived from the FAIR Principles for them are listed in [this folder](./Category-Specific%20Requirements).
