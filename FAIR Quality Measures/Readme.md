**FAIRness Quality Measures**
-------------------------------

This folder contains a list of the FAIRness quality measures and their definitions.

The FAIRness quality measures encapsulate the distinctive core concepts inherent in the descriptions of individual FAIR principles, depictured as pink-color filled round triangles in the dagram below, from Peng et al. (2024) 

They can serve as common, fundamental pillars of holistic FAIRness assessment workflows.
