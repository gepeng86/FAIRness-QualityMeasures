Dissecting the FAIR Principles
==============================

Wilkinson et al. (2016) designed high-level guiding principles under four nonfunctional requirements - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. We refer to these four nonfunctional requirements as four FAIR quality dimensions.

Wilkinson et al. (2016) also developed 15 FAIR principles to establish specific functional requirements for digital objects along the four FAIR quality dimensions in a computational environment. These 15 FAIR principles cover three unique high-level entities, or categories: data, metadata, and infrastructure. 

The principles also entail essential properties or specific functional requirements for each of the three categories. For example, F1 requires that data and metadata should each be assigned a property: identifier; the identifier is further qualified to be globally unique and eternally persistent. After mapping the 15 principles onto the three categories, 28 category-specific requirements are identified for data, metadata, and infrastructure. Additional details in this folder.

In contrast to its simple acronym, the FAIR Principles are highly complex even before accounting for domain and application dependencies. The FAIR principles are inherently multi-dimensional. They are also multi-layered and multi-faceted, revolving around key concepts with multiple elements, as depicted in the first figure below.

By decomposing the definitions of the FAIR principles through a systematic concept mapping approach, Peng (2023) deduced 21 unique category-specific core concepts and 48 category-specific elements, and formulated 85 harmonized indicators for FAIR data. The second figure below ties all these together.
